Daytona enables collaboration by allowing you to open your workspace to others. You can open the workspace to the public or limit it to your specific network, depending on your deployment. This feature makes it easy to share your work with colleagues, customers, or anyone with access to your Daytona instance.

### Invite Members

You can add members through the Daytona dashboard at the [Members](https://daytona.work/team/members) page. You can also add members by importing the CSV file having the member's email addresses.

### Collaboration Terminals

Daytona's Collaboration Terminals allow multiple users to work together in the same terminal concurrently. This is perfect for pair programming, debugging, and collaborative tasks. When you're done, simply close or exit the terminal.
