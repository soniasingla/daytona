In Daytona, you can delete a workspace when it's no longer needed. To delete a workspace, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Go to the Workspace Dashboard, where you will see a list of your active workspaces. Each workspace is represented by a different color to indicate its [status](../what-are-workspaces/#workspace-lifecycle).


2. Select the workspace that you want to delete. In the top-right corner of the workspace container, click on the three dots and select the `Delete` option.

Please note that this action is irreversible.
