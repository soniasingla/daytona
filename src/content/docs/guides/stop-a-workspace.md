In Daytona, you can easily stop a running workspace to manage your work environment as needed. To stop a workspace, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Go to the [Workspace Dashboard](https://daytona.work/), where you will see a list of your active workspaces. Each workspace is represented by a different color to indicate its [status](../workspaces#workspace-lifecycle).


2. Select the workspace that you want to stop. In the top-right corner of the workspace container, click on the three dots and select the `Stop` option.

This action will trigger the process of transitioning the workspace from its current state to the `STOPPING` status. After a short interval, the workspace will be completely stopped, and its status will change to `STOPPED`.
