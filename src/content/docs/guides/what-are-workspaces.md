description: A guide on Daytona Workspaces

A workspace is a self-contained development environment, pre-configured with the project's source code, required dependencies, necessary tools, and extensions to optimize workflow for your development team.

Daytona workspaces simplify the setup and configuration of development environments, integrate various tools, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure a consistent experience across different teams and projects. By following established practices and automation, Development Environment Management ensures that all developers have access to a consistent, secure, and standardized environment, ultimately enhancing productivity and streamlining the software development process.


## Workspace Lifecycle

In the [Daytona dashboard](https://daytona.work/), you can easily monitor your workspace's condition through the color-coded workspace indicator. Here's what each status signifies:

- ðŸŸ  Starting: This status indicates that the workspace is being prepared for use and is not yet accessible to the user.

- ðŸŸ¢ Started: This status indicates that the workspace is fully operational and accessible for the user.

- ðŸŸ¡ Stopping: This status indicates that the workspace is in the process of being stopped and backups are in progress.

- ðŸ”´ Stopped: This status indicates that the workspace is no longer accessible but the users can restart the workspace if needed in the future.
