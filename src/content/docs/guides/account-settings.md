[Account settings](https://daytona.work/account/settings) allow you to customize your own personal Daytona experience.

### Account Information

Account information includes your unique account ID, your registered name, and the associated email address with your Daytona account. Ensure your account details are up-to-date and accurate.

### Git Providers

You can manage permissions for the Git providers connected to your account. It lists your connected Git providers, such as GitLab and GitHub, along with their corresponding usernames. You can manage, review, and modify your Git provider settings.

### Default Editor

You have the option to select your preferred default editor for opening workspaces. Simply use the dropdown menu to make your choice.

### Dotfiles

A dotfile is a configuration file that controls the settings and preferences for applications and your system environment. They enable you to customize your tools and system according to your preferences, such as adding custom aliases, tweak style preferences, and enabling plugins. Dotfiles are a valuable means to enhance productivity and create a personalized, transferable environment that can be used across different systems.

You can add a repository URL that includes your dotfiles. Daytona will clone and install your dotfiles for every new workspace.

## Environment Variables

You have the option to include [environment variables](https://daytona.work/account/environment-variables) in your workspaces. These variables can store sensitive information such as passwords and secret keys. By default, they will be added to each of your workspaces.

## SSH Keys

To establish a secure connection to your workspace, you can add your public [SSH keys here](https://daytona.work/account/ssh-keys). This ensures a safe and encrypted link to your workspace environment.
